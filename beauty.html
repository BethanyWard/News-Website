                    Telling the people you care about that you're a vampire is no easy thing. Often times, we're met with pitchforks and a mob of angry villagers. 
                    However, it's still important to feel appreciated and seen by the people around you! The best way to make sure you're safe when announcing your
                    status is to use mind control on anyone in earshot. It may seem like you're violating the terms of their friendship and privacy, and that's becuase you are.
                    But with enough mind control, your friends won't care about that either. <br>
                    Here are some comments from people who tried this method: <br> <br>
                    "I feel so much safer" <br> <br>
                    "My friends love me so much more now!" <br> <br>
                    "Grandma had a heart attack after I tried this. She's okay now, but it was a close one"
                    <br> <br>

                    This Vampire Spray-Tan is "Unforgetable"
                </h2>

                <p class="morbs">
                    Fenty Beauty recently released a new spray-on tan marketed specifically towards vampires and other people who can't stand in direct sunlight.
                    At first, the reviews were mixed. "I look like a Walmart Kardashian," one reviewer said. Another commented, "I like the way it makes my skin tingle."
                    But when the famous vampire and fashion influencer Arnold Schwarzenegger tried it, he said "I'll be back." And he was back, the very next day with a horrible chemical
                    burn.
