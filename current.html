            Anti-Vampire Group says they "Love Garlic Bread"
            </h2>

          <p class="uhhhidk"> 
            A group of moms have banded together to express their distaste for vampires, stating "they're literally drinking people's blood."
            These moms have taken to wearing t-shirts and holding signs that read "I Heart Garlic" and bringing garlic bread to community functions.
            Their actions have led to an incredible decrease in the vampire populations as people realise the consequences of vampirism, and vampires everywhere
            are feeling the loss of a once wonderful meal. <br> <br>
            Stay strong, friends. We may not have garlic bread, but at least we can turn into bats (which is pretty cool).

                 Cancel Culture is killing the Candelabra
             </h2>

             <p class="morbs">
                 Candelabras are an essential part of the vampire lifestyle. Without them, how would we enter rooms with a sense of gravitas?
                 How would fair maidens flee from our gloomy castles without a candleabra to guide her way? How would we be able to watch 'Beauty and the Beast'
                 without the charming french dialect of local candelabra Lumière? <br> <br>
                 Cancel culture has taken our beloved household item and painted it as "unsafe" and "outdated." But in our modern world, it's important
                 vampires everywhere stand up for our beliefs! Call your senator today and tell him "Candelabras are still rad."
