           <h2 class="main">Robert Pattinson is a FRAUD?!</h2>     
           <img class="fraud" src="fraud.png">

           <p>
            Robert Pattinson, famous for his role of 'Edward' in the Twilight series, shocks fans around the world by announcing "I'm not actually a vampire, guys."
            This revelation, coupled with the fact that he seems unharmed by the sun and has been seen regularly enjoying garlic bread, has devastated entire communities.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following Robert's comment, one man (who wished to remain anonymous) said "Hey, that's the guy who plays Batman."
            Unfortunately, it seems Robbie is no 'bat-man' after all. </p>

            <h2 class="main">Is Morbius to Blame for Rising Gas Prices?</h2>

            <p class="morbs"> After its less than successful release, the movie "Morbius"
                has been an easy target for jokes. However, this failed blockbuster is so much more than a laughing stock: as gas prices increase around the world,
                you and others might have briefly thought 'It's that darn Morbius's fault.' After doing no research, a team of scientists decided that yes, it is that
                darn Morbius's fault. Could a failed Marvel movie truly be the cause for such a big economic problem? No one knows, because they're not willing to watch
                the movie to find out.
